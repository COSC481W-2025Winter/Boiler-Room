## Project Description

A webapp that keeps track of your videogame library (manual or Steam API imports) and uses it to recommend games that 1. Are highly reviewed by users/audience and/or critics and 2. Do not take a lot of time to complete. Parameters and filters can be tweaked to userâ€™s liking and data can be imported from WebAPIs/Webscraping if needed, or if none of the above is available, user submitted data. Games can be marked as completed to remove them from the recommendation pool. Additional functionality may include recommending games that are not already in the users library for future purchase, which could even involve an AI element. Another potential functionality to add would involve showing only games that are shared between two users to recommend multiplayer games for them.

## Team Member Bios

### Jonathan

My name is Jonathan, I am a senior majoring in computer science at Eastern Michigan University. I have the most experience coding in Java, but I have done some work in Javascript, Python, and C#. My passion is in backend development, as I enjoy seeing all the work put into a project pay off. I love hanging out with my friends, whether that means sitting around and chatting for hours on end, board games, or trying something new. 

### Eric

### Chris

My name is Chris, I am a data science major senior at Eastern Michigan University. This is my last semester before graduation. In my spare time I enjoy going to the gym as well as playing board games with my friends. When it comes to coding my prefered language is Python and I mostly work with webscraping/api collection tools as well as visualisations using that information.

### Jack

### Trevor

My name is Trevor, I am a computer science major and a senior in my last semester at EMU. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, going to the gym (when I can), and working on side projects. From my courses I have the most experience with Java, although I more so prefer the simplicity of Python along with using it for Machine Learning and neural networks. 

### Ethan

### Matt

Hey there! I'm Matt, but often go by Boonem. I'm a Computer Science Senior at EMU passionate about media and storytelling (including games!) as well as making innovative digital experiences, both practical and more creative. My other off-the-clock activities include enjoying the company of my favorite people and critters, losing myself in the world of a movie or game, or meddling with musicmaking. My idea for BoilerRoom originated as a simple spreadsheet to help traverse my overgrown library of untouched games, and I am excited to see the places our team will take it.
