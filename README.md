## Project Description

A webapp that keeps track of your videogame library (manual or Steam API imports) and uses it to recommend games that 1. Are highly reviewed by users/audience and/or critics and 2. Do not take a lot of time to complete. Parameters and filters can be tweaked to userâ€™s liking and data can be imported from WebAPIs/Webscraping if needed, or if none of the above is available, user submitted data. Games can be marked as completed to remove them from the recommendation pool. Additional functionality may include recommending games that are not already in the users library for future purchase, which could even involve an AI element. Another potential functionality to add would involve showing only games that are shared between two users to recommend multiplayer games for them.
